# Improved-Euler-Method-ODE-Solver
A MATLAB project to create a custom ODE solver using the Improved Euler (Heun) method and compare its results with MATLAB's built-in ode45. Includes exercises on implementing adaptive step size methods, error analysis for Euler's method, and plotting solutions to initial value problems. Designed for hands-on learning in numerical methods.
